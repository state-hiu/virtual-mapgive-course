# Introduction to OpenStreetMap

The objective of this assignment is to get you mapping right away in OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Anyone can create an account and start contributing right away, and people do for all types of reasons. 

For this assignment you will create an account on OpenStreetMap.org if you don't already have one, complete the tutorial, and map some point of interests (POIs) in your neighborhood.

After you are zoomed in far enough to your location the 'Edit' button on the top-hand menu bar should stop being greyed out. Click on the 'Edit' button and it will open the iD editor, all within your web-browser!



Don't be intimitated, there is a great Walkthrough to help get you started. If the Walkthrough didn't pop-up automatically, navigate to the 'Help' button on the right-hand navbar and click on the 'Start the Walkthrough' button).

## Assignment: Neighborhood Mapping

Mapping: Remember features in OSM can be represented in one of three different ways. Some features can be represented by more than one type. For additional guidance on the different types of features that can be added, look at the OpenStreetMap Wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page. For part of this assignment, you must map three of each type of feature (point, line, and area). When mapping you have the choice to either create a new feature or modify an existing feature by improving its geometry or attribution. Save your edits, and list the features you created and the osm ids. You can find this out easily by visiting your profile page, then clicking on 'My Edits'. 

Written assignment (min 250 words): Where is your neighborhood and how did the map in OpenStreetMap appear compared to what you expected? Explain what types of features you added, and what type of attributes. Did you have any difficulties editing? Assess the state of the quality of neighborhood map? Are there any gaps? What are some different ways it is possible to measure the quality of maps?
